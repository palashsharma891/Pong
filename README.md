# Pong
Here I have implemented the famous classic pong game implemented using the *turtle* module in Python.

## How To Play
Player A: **Up** -> 'w' key; **Down** -> 's' key

Player B: **Up** -> 'Up arrow' key; **Down** -> 'Down arrow' key

Sometimes *turtle* can be mysterious. Feel free to ask anything about this project. Here is my email: palashsharma891@gmail.com
